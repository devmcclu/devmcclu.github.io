Postmortem - https://gamasutra.com/blogs/DevlinMcClure/20200521/362931/Game_Engine_Food_Physics_Or_Where_Soft_Bodies_Can_Take_Us.php
An experiment focusing on creating programmatically designed food physics in game engines. This explores the possibilities available to create soft body entities in Unreal Engine 4, and how those soft bodies can be manipulated in engine. Using NVIDIA&amp;rsquo;s FleX library, I created soft body meshes as a starting point of exploring the physics, while later moving on to Material based soft body&amp;rsquo;s to allow meshes to be changed using the Procedural Mesh object as a base.</description>
