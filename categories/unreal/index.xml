Solo Project
A project focusing on creating tools and expanding the use of Unreal Engine for a 3D unit management simultanious networked multiplayer game. In this, I explored ways developers can mix the use of C++ and Blueprints in a project and how to best spend time when building a game and other tools.
Features  Simultanious networked multiplayer 3D Tilemap Editing Tool Custom C++ and Blueprint data types  Tilemap Editor Purpose Making grid based games in 2D has been done fairly well, in tools such as Tiled and the build in Tilemap tools in Unity and Godot.</description>

Postmortem - https://gamasutra.com/blogs/DevlinMcClure/20200521/362931/Game_Engine_Food_Physics_Or_Where_Soft_Bodies_Can_Take_Us.php
An experiment focusing on creating programmatically designed food physics in game engines. This explores the possibilities available to create soft body entities in Unreal Engine 4, and how those soft bodies can be manipulated in engine. Using NVIDIA&amp;rsquo;s FleX library, I created soft body meshes as a starting point of exploring the physics, while later moving on to Material based soft body&amp;rsquo;s to allow meshes to be changed using the Procedural Mesh object as a base.</description>
